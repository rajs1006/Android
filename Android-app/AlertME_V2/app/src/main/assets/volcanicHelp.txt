Volcanic Eruption

Being of volcanic origin with ongoing activity, the Island of Hawai?i is vulnerable to volcanic eruptions and lava flows. The Hawai?i Volcano Observatory (HVO) usually provides information about impending activity. Civil Defense (CD) issues advance warning/evacuation notices to the public regarding volcanic activity but at times may not be able to do so due to the unpredictable nature of volcanoes.

Upon receiving a warning notice:

1.  Tune in to an Emergency Broadcast System radio station for latest advisory information.
2.  If advised to prepare for evacuation, personnel should secure equipment and buildings; they may also remove valuable items that are relatively easy to transport.
3.  If advised to evacuate, keep in mind that in the event of an eruption and lava flow, a long term or permanent evacuation may be possible. The lava flow may cut off roads, utilities and partially or completely destroy property. Alternative sites to conduct operations may become necessary.
